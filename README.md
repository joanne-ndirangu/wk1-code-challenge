# CODE CHALLENGE

## Description
This is a series of programs that meet the objectives set. The programs test your knowledge in javascript and apply things we've been taught so far.

### Objectives
1. Student Grade Generator
Should prompt the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and output the corresponding grade based on given grading system.
2. Speed Detector
Takes the speed of a car as input. If the speed is less than 70 it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5km/s above the speed limit which is 70, the driver should get one demerit point and the total number of demerit points printed. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print "License suspended"
3. Net Salary Calculator
The program should calculate an individual's net salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. The following links should be used for values:
